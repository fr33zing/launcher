#+TITLE: Plans

* Disclaimer

Nothing in this list is a commitment.

* Tweaks

Small changes to existing features.

** Change root to current instead of parent when moving node

Not sure this is optimal, but try it anyway.

** Move notice popup to bottom of screen

It's annoying how it covers the trash directory when you move something into the
trash. Maybe add a preference for popup position?

** Add "Set as default home screen" Setting node on first run

* Features

** Label format

Support markdown or a custom markup for label text.

** Launch animation

Show a cool animation when launching something.

** Indent guides

Show vertical lines to help track indentation.

** Cloud view

Visualize the tree as a cloud.

** Auto-trash checkbox preference

Add a preference that, when enabled, makes it so checkboxes are automatically
sent to the trash when checked.

** Multi-select for moving nodes

Moving multiple nodes one at a time is really annoying.
