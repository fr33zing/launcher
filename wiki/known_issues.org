#+TITLE: Known issues

* General

** Auto-rotate sends user to home screen

** Navigation transition to reorder page is janky

Might also affect some other pages.

* Nodes

** Nodes with empty label need a placeholder

Show something like <empty> at half opacity

** Icon is centered vertically

Should probably align to top. Maybe make a preference for this.

* References

Issues regarding Reference nodes.

** Target payload updates aren't reflected

1. Create a Checkbox
2. Create a Reference to it
3. Tap the reference

Probably need to use a flow for target payload.

** Rendering is inconsistent across views

** Infinite cycles are possible

1. Create a Directory
2. Create a Reference inside the Directory
3. Point the Reference at the Directory

* Tree view

Issues regarding the tree view, i.e. [[file:../app/src/main/java/dev/fr33zing/launcher/ui/components/node/RecursiveNodeList.kt::package dev.fr33zing.launcher.ui.components.node][RecursiveNodeList]].

** Last few nodes can be cut off

1. Scroll to bottom of tree view.
2. Long press the last node or one of the last 3(ish) nodes.

** Inconsistent line spacing when zoomed out

** Adding a node above the first node sometimes adds it below instead
